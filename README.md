>>> E = {2,4,6,8};
>>> N = {1,2,3,4};
>>> 
>>> print("union of E and N is",E | N )
union of E and N is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
>>> print("intersection of E and N is",E & N );
intersection of E and N is {2, 4}
>>> 
>>> print("difference of E ana N is " , E - N)
difference of E ana N is  {8, 6}
>>> print("symettric ifference of E na N is ", E and N)
symettric ifference of E na N is  {1, 2, 3, 4}
